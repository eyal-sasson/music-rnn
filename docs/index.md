**MusicRNN** is a [recurrent neural network][RNN] that generates music notes in the [ABC notation] format.
Using a simple RNN [model](model) written in Python using [Keras], and trained on [scraped data](data), the network is able to generate formatted text which can later be converted to actual audio.

If you want to experiment with the trained model on different datasets, check out [Play](play).
