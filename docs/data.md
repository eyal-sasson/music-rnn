# Data

All data is in the [ABC Notation] format. ABC notation is a widely-used music notation format that has its origins in the folk music communities of the 1970s. It was developed as a way of recording and sharing traditional tunes in a simple, easy-to-read format that could be easily printed or shared online. Since its creation, ABC notation has become a standard way of representing traditional music in many parts of the world, and has been used to transcribe thousands of tunes and songs. Today, it is commonly used by musicians and enthusiasts alike, and has played a significant role in the preservation and dissemination of traditional music.

The model was trained on multiple datasets. All datasets, except [Israeli Dances](#israeli-dances), were scraped from the [ABC Notation website][ABC].
The notebook showing the scraping process can be found [here](https://github.com/eyal-sasson/music-rnn/blob/main/Data_Scraping.ipynb).
